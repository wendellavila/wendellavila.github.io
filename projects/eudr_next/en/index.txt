This regulation specifically targets commodities such as timber, soy, beef, cocoa, coffee, palm oil, rubber, and their derivatives.\nOperators and traders, both in Brazil and globally, must comply with the EUDR when exporting certain commodities to the EU. The law bans the import of products originating from areas with any level of deforestation identified up to December 2020."},"deforestation":{"title":"How is deforestation monitored?","details":"To certify that our coffee is deforestation-free, we retrieve information from 10 different government agencies and NGOs that publish data on deforestation. They are:\nSome of these agencies, such as PRODES and MapBiomas, monitor forest regions via satellite and publish deforestation alerts periodically. Others, such as IBAMA and SEMA-MT, publish lists of offenders and embargoed areas.\nThe geolocation of farms are retrieved from SICAR - the Rural Environmental Registry System, and with it we are able to cross-reference deforestation alerts and embargoes with coffee-supplying farms.\nBy using this data, we can guarantee that the coffee being exported comes from farms without deforestation and belonging to an owner without environmental embargoes."},"platform":{"title":"How does the platform work?","details":"The EUDR compliance tracking platform allows our customers to view deforestation reports and the geolocation of farms that supplied coffee for their purchases.\nFor each of their purchases, the customer has access to the list of farms that supplied coffee to it. The platform lists the status of each farm in all of the deforestation monitoring agencies at the time the coffee was shipped, giving transparent access to customers to the same data we use to certify the coffee shipped.\nIn addition to deforestation reports, the geolocation of each farm is displayed in an interactive map. Their coordinates can be exported in GeoJSON and KML formats."},"access":{"title":"How do I gain access to the platform?","details":"Access to the platform is granted on demand to our customers.
